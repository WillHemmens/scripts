'buildrom.sh'

Compile ROM's in 3 easy terminal commands:

$ git clone https://github.com/AzzyC/scripts.git

$ sudo chmod +x scripts/buildrom.sh

$ bash scripts/buildrom.sh

One eternity later...

Profit!

Factoring in PC power and internet speed, the default script will compile an Unofficial Lineage15.1 build for starlte and star2lte, containing baked-in Endurance Kernel, revert to Oreo vendor, call recording, etc. Find more changes viewing each repositories commit history.

The script is ready to be adapted from the included example commands, waiting to be enabled, to the thorough guiding comments covering all details to compile what you would like and doing so properly. With @synt4x93, his manifest and crownlte tree, @ivanmelers alpha Pie tree are just a '#' removal away, and/or to switch the source to build a different ROM and plenty more to find inside the file. The script should therefore encourage users to begin experimenting and better learn the ropes on how to compile than traditional methods. It would be recommended for you follow-though reading the script a couple of times to then make suitable edits.

Effectively, the script runs commands which would have otherwise been inputted by manual input which gets tedious and repetitive over time, so this script automates them to keep compiling interesting. With the comments thoroughly describing the commands in detail, this script not only aims to automate but to teach users how they could adapt and compile ROM's with their future devices.

Compiling code should be the easy part, its major thanks to the developers that give us foundation sources for us to use and take liberty with.
